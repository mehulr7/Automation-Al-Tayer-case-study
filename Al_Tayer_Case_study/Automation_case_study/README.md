This repository contains the case study 

Case 1
case 1.2
Case 2
Case 2.2

To run the script I have created Run.bat file. Just double click on it. Test will run automatically. All the dependencies are added into the pom.xml file.

Last code was not easy to understand and readable so i have written the scripts from scratch using maven and cucumber(BDD). It is much easier to understand as compared to TDD. In this way the code is easy to manage. Anyone stakeholders/users can read the code easily as its methods name shows its flow.

I have given meaningful variable names. Anyone can understand what type of value is contained in the variable.

Yes I checked whole the scenario written in one function. But I have created one Action class where most of the actions are stored, Just used these function in frontend. I have separated all function and created 4 classes for each scenario. In Common class I have written reusable code and used it.

I have created two configuration files to store the locators (Page objects) by its name. In case in the future any locator will change then You just need to update it in that file not in the code.

I have added TestNG assertion in code to verify the functionality.

Note1: I have also added logs using extent report. You can see the logs(Steps) of the scenarios in Logs folder Note: I have also added a results folder you can see the execution result in the graphical html report. Thanks to Anish Aroora - He has a Github page and a really useful reusable tool to report!

If you want to alter the project. Import the project in eclipse or an IDE. Right click on project >> Go to maven >> Click on Update project >> Then right click on project >> Go to run and click on run with maven install.

Thanks!
